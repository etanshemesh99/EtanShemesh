							<h1>My Mission</h1>
							<p class="major">My mission is to bring great ideas and products into the world, and make the earth a more safe and efficient place.<br>I want to lead projects that will change the world, but that may take a while to get to, so here's what I've been doing in the mean time.</p>

							<h2>About Me</h2>
							<p>I am from a town outside of Philadelphia called Newtown, and I follow a "work hard, play hard" mentality. Hobbies of mine include Scuba-Diving, deep sea fishing, sailing, and being in the outdoors with my friends. Since I was in middle school, I knew I wanted to be an engineer and design products for a living. I love to travel with my family and see the world.   </p>

							<h2>Past Projects</h2>
							<p>Through my internships and engineering classes I have had the opportunity to work on many amazing projects, in many different fields. One project I have been apart of is a recycling project in my freshman year at the University of Pittsburgh in my engineering class. In our 3 person team, we followed the engineering cycle and designed a prototype to solve a recycling problem around our campus. My group designed a product that cleaned small batches of contaminated recyclables using high-power water jets and an innovative design. My other projects I have completed at my internships at the Sapling company are listed below with images and more in-depth discussion.</p>

							<h2>Leash spooler</h2>
							<p>Shwon below is the machine I created and desinged over the summer of 2020. This machine uses removable rods, a stepper motor, arduino, and a backr-roller for support to coil blue plastic wire around the removable rods, which are then heated to create leashes. After being heated, carabiners are attached to the leashes with help from oval cable crimps for fishing uses. Tocreate this machine, many parts had to be manfactured in China, so I made professional SOLIDWORKS drawings for the machinists. I also had to write the code for the arduino, find teh right driver and stepper motor, as well as wire multiple buttons for different length leashes. These leashes are now being sold in fishing stores all across New Jersey to retail customers.   </p>

							<h2>Jet Fuselage</h2>
							<p>This make-shft jet fuselage I designed is for passengers in a flight simulator, where passengers can side in this round structure in traditional jet-style seats for a hyper-realistic flight simulator. The main structure is built using quad metal extrusions with custom brackets I designed to allow for the extrusions to connect seemlessly hidden from the passengers sight. The outside has a 3003 aluminum shell and on the inside is plastic covered in leather. </p>

							<h2>Swimming Lure</h2>
							<p>This is a fishing lure I have designed for REEL INNOVATION fishing company. The displayed lure is a part used for trolling fishing which carries behind it fake squish which the fish bite on. Shown in the GIF is how the worm gear system works by using a fin powered worm shaft to cause an internal mechanism to oscillate the rudder in the water. Low density plastic floats are mounted on both ends to keep the lure afloat and allow the water to spin the worm shaft.</p>

							<h2>Travelling experience</h2>
							<p>Throughout my life, I have had the priveledge to seemany different countries and cultures across the glode, and have many eye-opening experiences along the way. This includes regular visits to my father's home country of Israel where we see our close relatives and remember our families routes. These travels have allowed me to pick up some adventurous hobbies, including scuba diving. I got my open water ertification in the 5th grade and have been diving ever since, and now I am na advanced diver with numerous specialty license with over 100 dives under my belt from some of the best diving locations in the world from the Great Barrier Reef to wreck dives in the British Virgin Islands. Scuba Diving has taught me a lot about how important it is that we take care of the earth and its finite recource, as humans need to understand our impact on the other animals we share this planet with, a beleif I carry over with me into my engineering career.  </p>

							<h2>Egg Drop Project</h2>
							<p>This egg-catching device is a project I am proud to put my name on, as it is a project I worked very hard on by myself, and the results of my hard work showed in the testing of the design. The task assigned was to build a device that could catch an egg dropped from high heights and keep the egg in tact when it fell into the device. My device combined many different materials to maximze the time between its initial impact with the catcher, and the point at which it had 0 velocity. With assistance of nonnewtownian fluids, packing-peanuts, and a peice of a mattress pad, my device had perfomed better than any deivce that was turned in to my teacher for as long as she was doing this project. My device was caught an egg in-tact from a higher distance than anyone else who had completed this project with my teacher. Although this is not as complex and impressive as some of my other projects, this invention is where my interest in engineering peaked, and the class that made me realize the career path I want to take.</p>
