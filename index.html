							<h2>About Me</h2>
							<p>I am an engineering student from outside of Philadelphia and am passionate about innovation, sustainability, and solving people's problems through engineering solutions. I had the opportunity to attend the University of Pittsburgh where I developed my skills and knowledge in the field of engineering. I am proud to have interned as an engineer at two different companies and studied abroad in Sydney, Australia, where I was able to gain a unique global perspective on the industry. I am highly skilled in technical communication and have a natural ability to connect with others and form strong relationships, making me an extroverted and social person. As I approach graduation in April 2023, I am eager to put my skills and experience to use and am eager to start my career as a sales engineer, where I can use my passion for innovation and problem-solving to make a positive impact in the world. Hobbies of mine include Scuba-Diving, deep sea fishing, sailing, and being in the outdoors with my friends.   </p>

							<h2>Past Projects</h2>
							<p>As a student and intern, I have had the privilege of participating in a wide variety of projects across several fields. Many of these projects required the use of microcontrollers, such as the Arduino Uno and ATMega 328P, as well as CAD software and coding. Throughout my projects, I have consistently followed the engineering design process, ensuring that each project is completed to the highest standard. I have also had the opportunity to work on projects both independently and as part of a team. My internships at Schroeder Industries and Sapling Inc. provided valuable hands-on experience in the field of engineering. In addition to working with microcontrollers, I also honed my leadership skills by leading meetings and presenting project updates to my team. Overall, these experiences have helped to prepare me for a successful career in the field of engineering.</p>

							<h2>Leash spooler</h2>
							<p>During the summer of 2020, I successfully designed and fabricated a specialized machine for coiling blue plastic wire into leashes for fishing applications. The machine utilizes a combination of removable rods, a high-precision stepper motor, an Arduino microcontroller, and a back-roller support mechanism to efficiently produce the desired product. The manufacturing process involves coiling the plastic wire around the removable rods, followed by heating the rods to set the shape of the leash. Subsequently, carabiners are attached to the leashes using oval cable crimps to provide increased functionality for fishing applications.

							To ensure that the machine was manufactured to exact specifications, I created professional SOLIDWORKS drawings for the machinists in China. The Arduino code was written by me and carefully optimized to meet the requirements of the project. I also sourced and integrated a suitable stepper motor and driver, and wired multiple buttons to enable users to select different leash lengths. The end product has been met with great success and is now available for purchase at fishing stores throughout New Jersey.   </p>

							<h2>Jet Fuselage</h2>
							<p>This make-shift jet fuselage I designed is for passengers in a flight simulator, where passengers can sit inside in this round structure in traditional jet-style seats for a hyper-realistic flight simulator experience. The main structure is built using quad metal extrusions with custom brackets I designed to allow for the extrusions to connect seemlessly hidden from the passengers sight. The outside has a 3003 aluminum shell and on the inside is plastic covered in leather. </p>

							<h2>Swimming Lure</h2>
							<p>This is a fishing lure I have designed for REEL INNOVATION fishing company. The displayed lure is a part used for trolling fishing which carries behind it fake squid which the fish bite on. Shown in the GIF is how the worm gear system works by using a fin powered worm shaft to cause an internal mechanism to oscillate the rudder in the water. Low density plastic floats are mounted on both ends to keep the lure afloat and allow the water to spin the worm shaft.</p>

							<h2>Travelling experience</h2>
							<p>Throughout my life, I have had the priveledge to seemany different countries and cultures across the glode, and have many eye-opening experiences along the way. This includes regular visits to my father's home country of Israel where we see our close relatives and remember our families roots. These travels have allowed me to pick up some adventurous hobbies, including scuba diving. I got my open water certification in the 5th grade and have been diving ever since, and now I am an advanced diver with numerous specialty license with over 100 dives under my belt from some of the best diving locations in the world from the Great Barrier Reef to wreck dives in the British Virgin Islands. Scuba Diving has taught me a lot about how important it is that we take care of the earth and its finite recource, as humans need to understand our impact on the other animals we share this planet with, a belief I carry over with me into my engineering career.  </p>

							<h2>Egg Drop Project</h2>
							<p>This egg-catching device is a project I am proud to put my name on, as it is a project I worked very hard on by myself, and the results of my hard work showed in the testing of the design. The task assigned was to build a device that could catch an egg dropped from high heights and keep the egg in tact when it fell into the device. My device combined many different materials to maximze the time between its initial impact with the catcher, and the point at which it had 0 velocity. With assistance of nonnewtownian fluids, packing-peanuts, and a peice of a mattress pad, my device had perfomed better than any deivce that was turned in to my teacher for as long as she was doing this project. My device was caught an egg in-tact from a higher distance than anyone else who had completed this project with my teacher. Although this is not as complex and impressive as some of my other projects, this invention is where my interest in engineering peaked, and the class that made me realize the career path I want to take.</p>
