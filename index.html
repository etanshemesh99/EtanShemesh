							<h1>My Mission</h1>

							<h2>About Me</h2>
							<p>I am from a town outside of Philadelphia called Newtown, and I follow a "work hard, play hard" mentality. Hobbies of mine include Scuba-Diving, deep sea fishing, sailing, and being in the outdoors with my friends. Since I was in middle school, I knew I wanted to be an engineer and design products for a living. I love to travel with my family and see the world.   </p>

							<h2>Past Projects</h2>
							<p>One major project I have been apart of is a recycling project in my freshman year at the University of Pittsburgh in my engineering class. In our 3 person team, we followed the engineering cycle and designed a prototype to solve a recycling problem around our campus. My group designed a product that cleaned small batches of contaminated recyclables using high-power water jets and an innovative design.</p>

							<h2>Step 1: Empathize</h2>
							<p>The first step of our design process was to empathize with the people that face the problem we were trying to solve. My teams specific how might we question was "How might we facilitate decontaminating people's recyclables?" Our team interviewed students around our campus about reccling, their knowledge of it, and how it can be made easier. Our team really tried to understand the customers habits and lives, and which solutions would work best. </p>

							<h2>Step 2: Ideate</h2>
							<p>The next step in my teams design process was to come up with as many solutions as possible that could solve our how might we question. My team had gone through so many different ideas and ways to solve this problem until we arrived at a solution which solved the problem in an effeiceint manner, and a product worth investing in.</p>

							<h2>Step 3 and 4: Prototype and Refine</h2>
							<p>After settling on an idea, my team and I set out to bring this idea into life, with a 1:1 size prototype. Using cardboard, clay, hot glue, amung other materials we built a prototype that effectively showed the idea in pratice, and simply shown the process which the recyclables undergo to be decontaminated. We presented our product to our class, interviewed more potential costumers, and further refined our design to become more effecient.</p>

							<h2>Egg Drop Project</h2>
							<p>This egg-catching device is a project I am proud to put my name on, as it is a project I worked very hard on by myself, and the results of my hard work showed in the testing of the design. The task assigned was to build a device that could catch an egg dropped from high heights and keep the egg in tact when it fell into the device. My device combined many different materials to maximze the time between its initial impact with the catcher, and the point at which it had 0 velocity. With assistance of nonnewtownian fluids, packing-peanuts, and a peice of a mattress pad, my device had perfomed better than any deivce that was turned in to my teacher for as long as she was doing this project. My device was caught an egg in-tact from a higher distance than anyone else who had completed this project with my teacher.</p>
