							<h2>About Me</h2>
							<p>I am an engineering student from outside of Philadelphia and am passionate about innovation, sustainability, and solving people's problems through engineering solutions. I had the opportunity to attend the University of Pittsburgh where I developed my skills and knowledge in the field of engineering. I am proud to have interned as an engineer at two different companies and studied abroad in Sydney, Australia, where I was able to gain a unique global perspective on the industry. I am highly skilled in technical communication and have a natural ability to connect with others and form strong relationships, making me an extroverted and social person. As I approach graduation in April 2023, I am eager to put my skills and experience to use and am eager to start my career as a sales engineer, where I can use my passion for innovation and problem-solving to make a positive impact in the world. Hobbies of mine include Scuba-Diving, deep sea fishing, sailing, and being in the outdoors with my friends.   </p>

							<h2>Past Projects</h2>
							<p>As a student and intern, I have had the privilege of participating in a wide variety of projects across several fields. Many of these projects required the use of microcontrollers, such as the Arduino Uno and ATMega 328P, as well as CAD software and coding. Throughout my projects, I have consistently followed the engineering design process, ensuring that each project is completed to the highest standard. I have also had the opportunity to work on projects both independently and as part of a team. My internships at Schroeder Industries and Sapling Inc. provided valuable hands-on experience in the field of engineering. In addition to working with microcontrollers, I also honed my leadership skills by leading meetings and presenting project updates to my team. Overall, these experiences have helped to prepare me for a successful career in the field of engineering.</p>

							<h2>Leash spooler</h2>
							<p>During the summer of 2020, I successfully designed and fabricated a specialized machine for coiling blue plastic wire into leashes for fishing applications. The machine utilizes a combination of removable rods, a high-precision stepper motor, an Arduino microcontroller, and a back-roller support mechanism to efficiently produce the desired product. The manufacturing process involves coiling the plastic wire around the removable rods, followed by heating the rods to set the shape of the leash. Subsequently, carabiners are attached to the leashes using oval cable crimps to provide increased functionality for fishing applications.

							To ensure that the machine was manufactured to exact specifications, I created professional SOLIDWORKS drawings for the machinists in China. The Arduino code was written by me and carefully optimized to meet the requirements of the project. I also sourced and integrated a suitable stepper motor and driver, and wired multiple buttons to enable users to select different leash lengths. The end product has been met with great success and is now available for purchase at fishing stores throughout New Jersey.   </p>

							<h2>Jet Fuselage</h2>
							<p>The design of a make-shift jet fuselage, intended for use in a flight simulator, is a testament to my engineering skills and creativity. This structure serves as the primary passenger cabin in the flight simulator and provides a hyper-realistic experience for users. The jet-style seats, arranged in a circular configuration within the fuselage, allow for a truly immersive experience.

							The main structure of the fuselage is constructed using quad metal extrusions, which are held together with custom brackets that I designed specifically for this project. The brackets are strategically placed to ensure a seamless connection between the extrusions, thus making them hidden from view. The exterior of the fuselage is covered with a 3003 aluminum shell, while the interior is lined with plastic and covered in leather for added comfort and durability.

							The design and construction of this make-shift jet fuselage demonstrate my ability to bring a creative concept to life and to create an effective solution that meets the needs of the user. It showcases my expertise in material selection, structural design, and project management, and highlights my dedication to providing high-quality results. </p>

							<h2>Finite Element Report</h2>
							<p>As a student studying abroad in Sydney, Australia in the fall of 2022, I was privileged to have the opportunity to enroll in a finite element methods class at the University of New South Wales. This class provided me with the hands-on experience and knowledge I needed to succeed in the field of engineering. The highlight of the class was writing a 24 page long finite element analysis report on carbon fiber running blades. The report was the result of extensive research and analysis using ANSYS, including design modeler and ANSYS ACP. The report explored different layup patterns, rosettes, and carbon fibers to determine which combination resulted in the highest spring constant. The study was thorough, covering topics such as verification, validation, and model definition, as well as several other important sections. This project provided me with a deep understanding of how FEA can be used to optimize the design of carbon fiber running blades and introduced me to many aspects of how detailed FEA can become. </p>

							<h2>PlantPal Pro</h2>
							<p> This mechantronic product helps grow plants at the fastest rate using optimal water and light levels, all controlled by this one system. Using 3 seperate circuits using ATMEGA328P microchips, the system reads temperature, moisture, and water levels to deliver the optimal water and light levels for the plant to grow, all connected to a gantry arm with a distance sensor that rises with the plant. This product uses multiple different mechatronic coding principles like A/D conversion, interuppts, and so much more. schematics for the design, and all circuitry were made in Eagle software, and in-depth calculations for motor selection were completed as well.

							<h2>Dog Alert System</h2>
							<p>As a part of my product realization class at the University of Pittsburgh, I was lucky enough to be a part of a team that developed a unique dog collar system. The collar was fitted with infrared LED lights and paired with a door sensor that used infrared sensors to detect when the dog was nearby. To power the LED lights, we used an ADAFRUIT playground microcontroller and a custom-made PCB, enclosed in a custom casing, that employed "pulse with modulation." The door mount, on the other hand, consisted of a wall plug, a speaker, an ADAFRUIT playground, a custom PCB, and infrared sensors, all housed in a custom casing. The system would sound an alarm when the dog collar was within a 3-foot radius of the door, alerting the owner that the dog wanted to go outside. It was a challenging but rewarding experience to bring this innovative solution to life.
